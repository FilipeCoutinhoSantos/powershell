# WriteLog Module
I've seen many PowerShell scripts in my career.  Fantastic ones and aweful ones.  But I have very very rarely seen scripts where proper logging has been done.  Everyone seems to know write-output.  The clever ones know write-verbose and write-warning.  Some are really smart and write their own logging functions, allowing some level of customization.

But...

If you really want to show off with your logging, you need the full monty.  You want screen logging, rolling log files with automated time-stamps and you want event viewer logging.  Obviously, you want to have control of what and when.
Well, today is you lucky day, because I've written it for you :)

## Log4Net
If you want professional logging, why re-invent the wheel in the first place.  Microsoft wrote this dll ages ago and it does the job flawlessly.  But you need to know how it works.  It took me a very long time to have it configured correctly.
I could post the code here, but do you really want to see it ?  I've made you a nice module.  Just copy it to your modules and you should be all set.

## WriteLog module
I have full help enabled, so use the powershell get-help cmd-let to find out more.
* **Write-LogInfo** : Info message
* **Write-LogWarning** : Warning message
* **Write-LogError** : Error message
* **Write-LogFatal** : Fatal message
* **Write-Verbose** : Verbose message
* **Write-LogTitle** : Title message (with nice underline)
* **Write-LogErrorObject** : Error Object message (just pass the error object)
* **Write-LogSuccess** : Info-like message, but green in the console

``` powershell

Ouch, that wasn't ok

PS C:\jumpstart\wfaguy> $service = Get-Service W32Time

PS C:\jumpstart\wfaguy> $service | Select Name,DisplayName,Status

Now this is just the console logging part, here is the cool part :

## Initialize-Logger
Watch what happens, if you initialize the logger...  Note that I have added help in the code, get-help is your friend.

``` powershell
Initialize-Logger -LoggerName "WfaGuy"

```

## EventViewer
Note that it will log to the eventviewer too !  By default I've set the EventLevel to "warn". 
PS : first time, the eventlog source needs to be created, run-as administrator is required here !

All logging cmd-lets support "-eventid" and "-category".
